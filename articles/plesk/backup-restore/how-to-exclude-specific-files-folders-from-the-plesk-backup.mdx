This tutorial will guide you through the process of excluding specific files or folders from your Plesk backups. This is a useful technique to reduce the overall size of your backups and to avoid including files that you do not need to retain.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Log in to Plesk">
    Begin by logging into your Plesk account.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Access Backup & Restore">
    Navigate to **Websites & Domains**, then click on the **Pull icon** (usually represented by a downward arrow or similar icon), and select **Backup & Restore**.

        alt="Accessing Backup & Restore in Plesk"
        style={{ width: '100%', height: 'auto' }}
      />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Initiate Backup">
    Within the **Backup Manager**, click on the **Back Up** button.
    <Frame>
      <img
        src="/images/kb/plesk-backup-manager-generate.gif"
        alt="Initiating a backup in Plesk Backup Manager"
        style={{ width: '100%', height: 'auto' }}
      />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Backup Type">
    Choose the desired backup type. For this process, a **Full backup** is typically selected.
    <Frame>
      <img
        src="/images/kb/plesk-backup-full-option.gif"
        alt="Selecting the Full backup option in Plesk"
        style={{ width: '100%', height: 'auto' }}
      />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Exclusions">
    Check the box labeled **Exclude specific files from the backup**.
    <Frame>
      <img
        src="/images/kb/exclude-file-from-backup-plesk-account.gif"
        alt="Enabling file exclusion for Plesk backup"
        style={{ width: '100%', height: 'auto' }}
      />
    </Frame>
    <p>You will then be prompted to enter the paths of the files or folders you wish to exclude. Here are some examples:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        To exclude a specific file:
        <code>/httpdocs/directory/filename.jpg</code>
      </li>
      <li>
        To exclude an entire directory:
        <code>/httpdocs/images</code>
      </li>
      <li>
        To exclude files with specific extensions (e.g., all PNG files in the images directory):
        <code>/httpdocs/images/*.png</code>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm and Generate Backup">
    Click **OK** to confirm your selections. The backup process will begin in the background, and you can safely navigate away from the page.
  </Step>
</Steps>

You have now successfully configured your Plesk backup to exclude specific files or folders.
