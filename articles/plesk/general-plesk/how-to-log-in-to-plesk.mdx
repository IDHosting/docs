## Plesk Login URLs

You can access Plesk using the following URLs:

*   **SSL Protected:** `https://$hostname.com:8443`
*   **Non-SSL (Insecure):** `http://$hostname.com:8880`

## Login using the IP Address

You can also log in using your server's IP address. Note that using an IP address with SSL protection might require you to accept a security exception in your browser.

*   **SSL Protected (Requires Exception):** `https://$ip-here:8443`

After your domain has propagated, you can access Plesk using your domain name: `https://example.com:8443`.

<Note>
  If the URL does not open on port 8443, please check your Welcome email for the correct port number.
