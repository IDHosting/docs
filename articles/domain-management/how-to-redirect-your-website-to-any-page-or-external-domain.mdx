Redirecting your website is a useful technique for sending visitors to a new location, whether it's another page on your site or an entirely external domain. This is particularly helpful when you're moving your site, updating links, or consolidating content.

Follow these steps to set up a redirect:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Log in to your cPanel account">
    Access your cPanel account using your provided credentials.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Navigate to Redirects">
    In the **Domains** section, click on **Redirects**.

    <Frame>
      <img 
        src="/images/kb/cpanel-redirect.gif" 
        alt="cPanel Redirects interface"
        style={{ width: '100%', height: 'auto' }}
      />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure the Redirect">
    Under the **Add Redirect** section, you will need to configure the following details:

    *   **Type**: Choose between a **Permanent (301)** redirect, which tells search engines the content has permanently moved, or a **Temporary (302)** redirect, for short-term moves.
    *   **https?://(www.)?**: This field is for the source URL. You can leave it as is if you are redirecting the entire domain. If you wish to redirect a specific directory or page, enter its name in the text box.
    *   **Redirects to**: Enter the full URL of the destination where you want to redirect your visitors.

        style={{ width: '100%', height: 'auto' }}
      />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add the Redirect">
    Once you have entered all the necessary details, click the **Add** button to save your redirect.
