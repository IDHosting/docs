Parked domains, also known as aliases, are additional domains that point to your main website. If you no longer need one, you can easily remove it in cPanel.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Log in to cPanel">
    Access your cPanel account by logging in with your credentials.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Navigate to Domains">
    In the **Domains** section, click on the **Domains** icon.
    <Frame>
      <img
        src="/images/kb/cp-domains-icon.gif"
        alt="cPanel Domains Icon"
        style={{ width: '100%', height: 'auto' }}
      />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Locate and Manage Alias">
    In the list of domains, find the alias domain you wish to remove and click the **Manage** button next to it.
    <Frame>
      <img
        src="/images/kb/cp-list-of-domains.gif"
        alt="cPanel List of Domains"
        style={{ width: '100%', height: 'auto' }}
      />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Remove Domain">
    Click on **Remove Domain** and then confirm the action to remove the alias domain.
    <Frame>
      <img

        style={{ width: '100%', height: 'auto' }}
