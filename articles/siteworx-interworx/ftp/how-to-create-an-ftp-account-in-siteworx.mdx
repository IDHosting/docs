You can access your FTP account using your SiteWorx login details, which grants full access to your home directory. However, to create an FTP user account with access limited to a specific directory, you'll need to set up a separate FTP account.

<Steps>

  <Step title="Navigate to Add FTP Account">

    Fill in the following information for your new FTP account:
    <ul>

</Steps>

Your new FTP account is now created and ready to use with your FTP client. You can connect using the following details:

*   **Host:** Your website's IP address or domain name (e.g., `ftp.example.com`). Replace `example.com` with your actual domain.
*   **Username:** Your full FTP username, formatted as `username@yourdomain.com` (e.g., `John@example.com`).
*   **FTP Port:** `21` (This is the default port for FTP).
*   **FTP Password:** The password you set or generated for this FTP account.

You have successfully created your FTP account and can now begin uploading and managing files on your website.
