  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Software Setup">
    Under the **Software Setup** section, configure the following:
    *   **Choose Installation URL:** Select the desired protocol (HTTP or HTTPS) and your domain. If you wish to install bbPress in a subdirectory (e.g., `example.com/forum`), enter the directory name in the **In Directory** field. Leave it blank to install bbPress on your main domain (e.g., `example.com`).

  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Site Settings">
    In the **Site Settings** section, provide the following details:
    *   **Site Name:** Enter a name for your bbPress forum.
    *   **Site Description:** Provide a brief description of your forum.
    *   **Enable Multisite (WPMU):** Typically, you can leave this option as is unless you have specific requirements for a Multisite setup.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Up Admin Account">
    Under the **Admin Account** section, enter the following credentials for your bbPress administrator:
    *   **Admin Username:** Choose a username for your bbPress administrator. For security, avoid common usernames like `admin` or `administrator`.
    *   **Admin Password:** Create a strong and secure password.
    *   **Admin Email:** Enter a valid email address. This is crucial for password recovery and notifications.

    <Note>
      It is highly recommended to copy your admin username and password to a secure location, such as a Notepad file. You will need these credentials to access the bbPress admin area later.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Plugins (Optional)">
    In the **Select Plugin(s)** section, you can choose to install any additional plugins that might be offered or skip this step if you don't need any extra plugins at this time.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Advanced Options (Optional)">
    The **Advanced Options** section allows you to configure settings such as the database name or set up automated backups. You can generally leave these settings at their defaults unless you have specific needs. Be mindful that frequent backups can consume significant disk space.
