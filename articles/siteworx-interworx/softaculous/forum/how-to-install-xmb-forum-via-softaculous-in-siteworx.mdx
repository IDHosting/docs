  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Up Admin Account">
    In the **Admin Account** section, enter the following details:
    *   **Admin Username:** Choose a username for your XMB forum administrator. Avoid common usernames like "Admin" or "Administrator" for security reasons.
    *   **Admin Password:** Create a strong and secure password for your administrator account.
    *   **Admin Email:** Enter your email address. This is crucial for password recovery and receiving important notifications.

    <Note>
      It is highly recommended to copy your admin username and password to a secure location, such as Notepad, as you will need them to access your XMB forum's administrative area later.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Advanced Options (Optional)">
    The **Advanced Options** section allows you to configure database settings or set up automated backups. You can typically leave these settings at their defaults unless you have specific requirements. Be mindful that frequent backups can consume significant disk space.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Complete Installation">
    Scroll to the bottom of the page and click the **Install** button to finalize the installation of XMB Forum.
