  <Step title="Configure Software Setup">
    Under the **Software Setup** section, configure the following:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Choose Installation URL:</strong> Select the desired protocol (HTTP or HTTPS) and domain. In the <strong>In Directory</strong> field, enter a directory name if you wish to install MyBB in a subdirectory (e.g., `example.com/forum`). Leave this field blank to install MyBB on your main domain (e.g., `example.com`).

  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Board Settings">
    In the <strong>Board Settings</strong> section, provide the following details:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Site Name:</strong> The overall name of your website (e.g., "My Community").
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Board Name:</strong> The specific name for your MyBB forum.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Board E-mail:</strong> The primary email address for your forum.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Up Admin Account">
    Under the <strong>Admin Account</strong> section, enter:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Admin Username:</strong> Your desired username for the MyBB administrator account. For security, avoid common usernames like "admin" or "administrator".
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Admin Password:</strong> Create a strong and secure password for your admin account.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Admin Email:</strong> Your email address. This is crucial for password recovery and important notifications.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <Note>
      It is highly recommended to copy your admin username and password to a secure location, such as a Notepad file, immediately after setting them. You will need these credentials to log in to your MyBB admin control panel later.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Advanced Options (Optional)">
