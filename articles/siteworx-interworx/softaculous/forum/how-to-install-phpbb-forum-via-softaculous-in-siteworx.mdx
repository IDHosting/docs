  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Software Setup">
    In the **Software Setup** section, configure the following:
    *   **Choose Installation URL:** Select the desired protocol (HTTP or HTTPS) and your domain. If you wish to install phpBB in a subdirectory (e.g., `example.com/forum`), enter the directory name in the **In Directory** field. Leave it blank to install on your main domain (e.g., `example.com`).

      />

  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Board Settings">
    Under the **Board Settings** section, provide the following details:
    *   **Board Name:** The name of your forum.
    *   **Site Description:** A brief description of your forum.
    *   **Board E-mail:** The primary email address for your forum.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Up Admin Account">
    In the **Admin Account** section, enter:
    *   **Admin Username:** Your desired username for the phpBB administrator account. For security, avoid common usernames like "admin" or "administrator".
    *   **Admin Password:** Create a strong and secure password.
    *   **Admin Email:** Your personal email address.

    <Note>
      It is highly recommended to copy your admin username and password to a secure location, such as Notepad, as you will need them to access your phpBB admin control panel later.
    </Note>

      />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Advanced Options (Optional)">
    The **Advanced Options** section allows for more granular control, such as specifying a database name or configuring automated backups. Unless you have specific requirements, it's generally safe to leave these settings at their defaults. Be mindful that frequent backups can consume significant disk space.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Complete Installation">
    Scroll to the bottom of the page and click the **Install** button to begin the installation process.
