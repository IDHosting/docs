    Click the **Install** button to begin the FUDforum installation process.

      />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Software Setup">
    Under the **Software Setup** section, configure the following:
    *   **Choose Installation URL:** Select the desired protocol (HTTP or HTTPS) and domain. In the **In Directory** field, enter a directory name if you wish to install FUDforum in a subdirectory (e.g., `example.com/forum`). Leave this field blank to install FUDforum in the root of your domain (e.g., `example.com`).
    *   **Data Directory:** You can typically leave this field as the default.

    *   **Site Name:** Enter a name for your forum (e.g., "Community Hub").
    *   **Site Description:** Add a brief description of your forum.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Up Admin Account">
    In the **Admin Account** section, enter the following details:
    *   **Admin Username:** Choose a secure username for your FUDforum administrator. Avoid common usernames like "admin" or "administrator".
    *   **Admin Password:** Create a strong and unique password.
    *   **Admin Email:** Provide a valid email address for administrative purposes, such as password recovery and notifications.

      />
    </Frame>
    <Note>
      It is highly recommended to copy your admin username and password to a secure location, such as a password manager or a text file, immediately after setting them. You will need these credentials to access your FUDforum admin area later.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Advanced Options (Optional)">
    The **Advanced Options** section allows for further customization, such as changing the database name or configuring automated backups. Unless you have specific requirements, you can leave these settings at their defaults. Be mindful that frequent backups can consume significant disk space.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Complete Installation">
    Scroll to the bottom of the page and click the **Install** button to finalize the FUDforum installation.
