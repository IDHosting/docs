  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Software Setup">
    Under the **Software Setup** section, configure the following:
    *   **Choose Installation URL:** Select the desired protocol (e.g., `http` or `https`) and your domain.
    *   **In Directory:** If you wish to install Beehive in a subdirectory (e.g., `example.com/forum`), enter the directory name here. Leave this field blank to install Beehive in the root of your domain (e.g., `example.com`).

  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Site Settings">
    In the **Site Settings** section, provide the following:
    *   **Default Forum Webtag:** Enter a unique tag for your forum, such as `MyBeehive_Forum`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Up Admin Account">
    Under the **Admin Account** section, enter your administrator credentials:
    *   **Admin Username:** Choose a secure username for your Beehive administrator. Avoid common usernames like `admin` or `administrator`.
    *   **Admin Password:** Create a strong and complex password.
    *   **Admin Email:** Provide a valid email address. This is crucial for password recovery and notifications.

      />
    </Frame>

    <Note>
      It is highly recommended to copy your admin username and password to a secure location, such as a text file, as you will need them to access your Beehive forum's administrative area later.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Advanced Options (Optional)">
    The **Advanced Options** section allows for further customization, such as changing the database name or configuring automated backups. You can typically leave these settings at their defaults unless you have specific requirements. Be mindful that frequent backups can consume significant disk space.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Complete Installation">
    Scroll to the bottom of the page and click the **Install** button to finalize the Beehive Forum installation.
