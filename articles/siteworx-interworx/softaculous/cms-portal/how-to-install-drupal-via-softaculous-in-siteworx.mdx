  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Software Setup">
    Fill in the required fields under the **Software Setup** section:
    *   **Choose Installation URL:** Select the desired protocol (HTTP or HTTPS) and domain. In the **In Directory** field, enter a directory name if you wish to install Drupal in a subdirectory (e.g., `example.com/directory`). Leave this field blank to install Drupal on your main domain (e.g., `example.com`).
    *   **Choose the version you want to install:** It is recommended to leave this set to the latest available version.
    *   **Cron job:** This can typically be left at its default setting unless you have specific scheduling needs.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Site Settings">
    Under the **Site Settings** section, provide the following information:
    *   **Site Name:** Enter a name for your Drupal website (e.g., "My Awesome Drupal Site").
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Admin Account">
    In the **Admin Account** section, set up your Drupal administrator credentials:
    *   **Admin Username:** Choose a secure username for your Drupal administrator account. Avoid common usernames like "admin" or "administrator".
    *   **Admin Password:** Create a strong and complex password.
    *   **Admin Email:** Enter a valid email address for administrative purposes.

    <Note>
      It is highly recommended to copy your admin username and password to a secure location, such as a password manager or a text file, immediately after setting them. You will need these credentials to log in to your Drupal admin area later.
    </Note>

    </Warning>
