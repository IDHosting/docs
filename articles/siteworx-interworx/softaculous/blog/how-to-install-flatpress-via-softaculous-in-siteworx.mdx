  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Software Setup">
    Under the **Software Setup** section, configure the following:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Choose Installation URL:</strong> Select the desired protocol (HTTP or HTTPS) and your domain. In the <strong>In Directory</strong> field, enter a directory name if you wish to install FlatPress in a subdirectory (e.g., `example.com/blog`). Leave this field blank to install FlatPress in the root of your domain (e.g., `example.com`).
      </li>
    </ul>

      />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Up Admin Account">
    In the **Admin Account** section, provide the following details:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Admin Username:</strong> Choose a username for your FlatPress administrator account. For security, avoid common usernames like "admin" or "administrator".
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Admin Password:</strong> Create a strong and secure password.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Admin Email:</strong> Enter your email address.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <Note>
      It is highly recommended to copy your admin username and password to a secure location, such as a text file, as you will need them to log in to your FlatPress admin area later.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Advanced Options (Optional)">
    The **Advanced Options** section allows for further customization, such as changing the database name or configuring automated backups. You can generally leave these settings at their defaults unless you have specific requirements. Be mindful that frequent backups can consume significant disk space.
