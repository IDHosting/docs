  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Up Admin Account">
    Under the **Admin Account** section, enter:
    *   **Admin Username:** Choose a username for your Nibbleblog administrator account. Avoid common usernames like "admin" or "administrator" for security.
    *   **Admin Password:** Create a strong and secure password.
    *   **Admin Email:** Provide a valid email address for administrative purposes.

      />
    </Frame>
    <Note>
      It is highly recommended to copy your admin username and password to a secure location, such as Notepad, as you will need them to log in to your Nibbleblog admin area later.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Advanced Options (Optional)">
    The **Advanced Options** section allows you to customize database names or configure automated backups. Unless you have specific requirements, it's generally safe to leave these settings at their defaults. Be mindful that frequent backups can consume significant disk space.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Complete Installation">
    Scroll to the bottom of the page and click the **Install** button to finalize the installation.
