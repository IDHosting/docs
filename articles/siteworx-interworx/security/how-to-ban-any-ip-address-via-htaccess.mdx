This article explains how to block unwanted IP addresses from accessing your website by modifying your `.htaccess` file.

## Blocking an IP Address

To block an IP address, you need to add specific directives to your `.htaccess` file.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Locate or Create .htaccess File">
    Navigate to the root directory of your website. If a `.htaccess` file already exists, you will edit it. If not, create a new file named `.htaccess`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Blocking Directives">
    Open the `.htaccess` file in a text editor and add the following lines:
    ```apache
    order allow,deny
    deny from IP-ADDRESS
    allow from all
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Replace Placeholder">
    Replace `IP-ADDRESS` with the actual IP address you wish to block. For example, to block `192.168.1.100`, the lines would be:
    ```apache
    order allow,deny
    deny from 192.168.1.100
    allow from all
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save and Upload">
    Save the changes to your `.htaccess` file and upload it back to your website's root directory if you made changes locally.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
Ensure that your web server is configured to allow `.htaccess` overrides. If you are unsure, consult your hosting provider.
</Note>

## Blocking Multiple IP Addresses

To block multiple IP addresses, simply add a new `deny from` line for each IP address you want to block.

```apache
order allow,deny
deny from 192.168.1.100
deny from 10.0.0.5
deny from 172.16.0.1
allow from all
```

## Blocking an IP Address Range

You can also block a range of IP addresses using wildcards. For example, to block all IPs starting with `192.168.1.`:

```apache
order allow,deny
deny from 192.168.1.
allow from all
```

<Warning>
Be cautious when blocking IP address ranges, as you might unintentionally block legitimate users. Always double-check the range before implementing it.
</Warning>

## Blocking All IPs Except Specific Ones

If you want to allow only specific IP addresses and block all others, you can reverse the logic:

```apache
order deny,allow
deny from all
allow from 192.168.1.100
allow from 10.0.0.5
```

In this configuration:
- `order deny,allow` means that `deny` rules are processed first.
- `deny from all` blocks everyone by default.
- `allow from ...` then explicitly permits specific IP addresses.

<Tip>
It's a good practice to keep a backup of your `.htaccess` file before making any modifications.
