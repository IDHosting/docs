You can prevent unauthorized access to your `.htaccess` file by adding a specific rule to it. This is a crucial step for securing your website's configuration.

## Protecting Your .htaccess File

To protect your `.htaccess` file, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access your .htaccess file">
    You will need to access your website's root directory using an FTP client or your hosting provider's file manager. Locate the `.htaccess` file. If it doesn't exist, you may need to create it.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add the protection rule">
    Open the `.htaccess` file in a text editor and add the following lines at the beginning of the file:

    ```apache
    # .htaccess protection

    order allow, deny
    deny from all
    satisfy all
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save and upload the file">
    Save the changes to your `.htaccess` file and upload it back to your server.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  The `satisfy all` directive ensures that both access control rules (from `order allow, deny`) and any other directives in the `.htaccess` file are evaluated. This prevents direct access to the file itself while allowing other `.htaccess` rules to function.
</Note>

## How it Works

The added rules work as follows:

*   **`order allow, deny`**: This directive sets the order in which access control rules are processed. In this case, `allow` rules are processed first, followed by `deny` rules.
*   **`deny from all`**: This is the core of the protection. It explicitly denies access to the `.htaccess` file from any IP address.
*   **`satisfy all`**: This directive ensures that all access control rules are met. Since `deny from all` is in effect, no one can access the file directly.

By implementing this simple rule, you significantly enhance the security of your website by preventing unauthorized viewing or modification of your `.htaccess` file.
