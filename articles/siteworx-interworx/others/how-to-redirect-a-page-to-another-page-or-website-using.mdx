If a page on your website no longer exists and you want to redirect it to a new page or website, you can use the `.htaccess` file to redirect visitors.

## Redirect from a Specific Page to a Domain

This method redirects a specific page on your site to an external domain.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access your .htaccess file">
    You can usually find this file in the root directory of your website. If it doesn't exist, you can create it.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add the redirect rule">
    Open the `.htaccess` file in a text editor and add the following lines:
    ```apache
    RewriteEngine on
    Redirect 301 /mypage.html http://example.com
    ```
    Replace `/mypage.html` with the original page you want to redirect and `http://example.com` with the target domain.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save and upload the file">
    Save the changes to your `.htaccess` file and upload it back to your server.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
The `Redirect 301` command indicates a permanent redirect, which is best for SEO as it tells search engines that the page has moved permanently.

## Redirect from One Page to Another Page

This method redirects visitors from an old page on your site to a new page on the same site.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access your .htaccess file">
    Locate the `.htaccess` file in your website's root directory.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add the redirect rule">
    Add the following lines to your `.htaccess` file:
    ```apache
    # Redirect from a page/directory to another page
    Redirect 301 /oldpage.html /newpage.html
    ```
    Replace `/oldpage.html` with the original page and `/newpage.html` with the new page on your website.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save and upload the file">
    Save the `.htaccess` file and upload it to your server.
  </Step>
</Steps>

After implementing this, any visitor who tries to access `example.com/oldpage.html` will be automatically redirected to `example.com/newpage.html`.

<Tip>
Ensure there are no typos in your file names or paths, as this can prevent the redirect from working correctly.
