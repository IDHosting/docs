If your website uses long URLs like `example.com/files/folder/sitemap.html`, you can make them more concise, such as `example.com/sitemap`, by using the `.htaccess` file.

This guide will walk you through the process of modifying your `.htaccess` file to create cleaner, more user-friendly URLs.

## Steps to Create User-Friendly URLs

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enable Rewrite Engine">
    First, ensure the rewrite engine is enabled in your `.htaccess` file. Add the following line:

    ```apache
    RewriteEngine on
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Define the Rewrite Rule">
    Next, define the rule to map the user-friendly URL to the actual file path. Replace `sitemap/` with your desired user-friendly URL and `/files/folder/sitemap.html` with the actual path to your file.

    ```apache
    RewriteRule ^sitemap/$ /files/folder/sitemap.html [L]
    ```

    *   `^sitemap/$`: This is the pattern for the user-friendly URL. The `^` signifies the beginning of the string, `sitemap` is the desired URL slug, and `/$` signifies the end of the string.
    *   `/files/folder/sitemap.html`: This is the actual path to the file on your server.
    *   `[L]`: This flag means that this is the last rule to be processed if it matches.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save the .htaccess file">
    Save the changes to your `.htaccess` file. This file is usually located in the root directory of your website. If it doesn't exist, you can create it.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
Ensure that the `.htaccess` file is placed in the correct directory. For the rule above, it should be in the root directory of your website. If you are trying to rewrite a URL within a specific subdirectory, place the `.htaccess` file in that subdirectory.
</Note>

## Example Scenario

Let's say you have a page located at `example.com/products/electronics/television.php` and you want to make it accessible via `example.com/television`.

You would add the following lines to your `.htaccess` file:

```apache
RewriteEngine on
RewriteRule ^television/$ /products/electronics/television.php [L]
```

After saving the `.htaccess` file, you should be able to access your page using the cleaner URL `example.com/television`.

<Tip>
It's always a good practice to back up your `.htaccess` file before making any changes. This will allow you to easily revert to the previous configuration if something goes wrong.
