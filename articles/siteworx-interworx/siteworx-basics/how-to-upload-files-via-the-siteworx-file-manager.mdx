You can use SiteWorx's built-in File Manager as an alternative to using an FTP program for uploading files.

  <Step title="Log in to your SiteWorx account">
    Access your SiteWorx control panel by logging in with your credentials.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Navigate to File Manager">
    In the main SiteWorx dashboard, locate and click on the **File Manager** section, then click on **File Manager** again.

  <Step title="Select Your Domain">
    If you manage multiple domains, select the correct domain from the dropdown menu and click **Login**.

  <Step title="Navigate to the Target Directory">
    Browse to the specific directory where you wish to upload your file. For example, to upload a file to the `HTML` directory, click on it.

      />
    </Frame>

  <Step title="Select or Drag and Drop Files">
    Click on the upload area to browse and select files from your computer. The upload will start automatically. Alternatively, you can drag and drop files directly into the upload box.

Once the upload is complete, your files will be available in the File Manager, where you can manage them directly.
