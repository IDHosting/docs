  <Step title="Name Your Filter">
    Enter a descriptive name for your filter in the **Filter Name** input box.

  <Step title="Define Filter Rules">
    Configure the rules for your filter. For example, to filter emails containing specific words:
    <ol>
      <li>In the first dropdown menu, select <strong>Body</strong>.</li>
      <li>In the second dropdown menu, select <strong>Contains</strong>.</li>
      <li>In the text field, enter the word or phrase you want to filter (e.g., "Lottery").</li>
    </ol>
    <Frame>
      <img 
        src="/images/kb/create-filter-body.gif" 
        alt="Configuring filter rules to check the email body for specific content"
        style={{ width: '100%', height: 'auto' }}
      />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose an Action">
    From the **Actions** dropdown menu, select what you want to do with matching emails. For instance, choose **Discard Message** to delete them automatically.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save the Filter">
    Click on the **Create** button to save your new filter.
  </Step>
</Steps>

You have now successfully set up an account-level email filter in cPanel. This filter will help reduce the amount of spam reaching all your associated email accounts.
