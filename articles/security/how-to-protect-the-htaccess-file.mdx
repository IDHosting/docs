## Protecting Your .htaccess File

This guide explains how to secure your `.htaccess` file from unauthorized access by adding a specific rule.

### Steps to Protect Your .htaccess File

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access Your .htaccess File">
    Locate the `.htaccess` file in the root directory of your website. You can typically access this file via FTP or your hosting provider's file manager.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add the Protection Rule">
    Open the `.htaccess` file in a text editor and add the following lines at the beginning of the file:

    ```apache
    # .htaccess protection

    order allow, deny
    deny from all
    satisfy all
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save and Upload">
    Save the changes to your `.htaccess` file and upload it back to your server, overwriting the existing file.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  After implementing this rule, any attempt to directly access the `.htaccess` file through a web browser will be denied. This is a crucial security measure to prevent sensitive configuration information from being exposed.
</Note>

### Explanation of the Rule

*   `order allow, deny`: This directive specifies the order in which access control rules are processed. In this case, `allow` rules are processed first, followed by `deny` rules.
*   `deny from all`: This rule explicitly denies access to everyone.
*   `satisfy all`: This directive ensures that *all* access control rules (both Apache's and any other security modules) must be satisfied for access to be granted. When combined with `deny from all`, it effectively blocks all direct access.

This simple yet effective rule significantly enhances the security of your website by protecting your `.htaccess` file.
