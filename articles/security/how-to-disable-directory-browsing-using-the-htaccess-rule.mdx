<Info>
For security purposes, it is recommended to disable directory browsing on your website. This prevents unauthorized users from viewing the files and directories within your site.
</Info>

You can disable Directory Browsing by adding the following line to your `.htaccess` file:

```bash
Options -Indexes
```

This directive tells the web server not to display a list of files when a directory is accessed without an index file (like `index.html` or `index.php`).

### Steps to Implement

<Steps>
  <Step title="Locate or Create .htaccess File">
    Navigate to the root directory of your website (usually `public_html` or `www`). Look for a file named `.htaccess`. If it doesn't exist, you can create a new text file and name it `.htaccess`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add the Directive">
    Open the `.htaccess` file in a text editor. Add the following line to the file:
    ```bash
    Options -Indexes
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save and Upload">
    Save the changes to your `.htaccess` file. If you created the file, upload it to your website's root directory.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify">
    Test the change by navigating to a directory on your website that does not contain an index file. You should now see a "403 Forbidden" error or a similar message, instead of a list of files.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
Always back up your `.htaccess` file before making any changes. An incorrect configuration can lead to website errors.
