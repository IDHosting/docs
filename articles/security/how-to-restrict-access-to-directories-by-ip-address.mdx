description: "Learn how to secure your directories by allowing access only from specific IP addresses using an .htaccess file."
---

To secure sensitive directories, such as your admin area, you can restrict access to only allow connections from specific IP addresses. This is achieved by creating an `.htaccess` file within the directory you wish to protect.

For example, if you want to secure your WordPress admin directory (`wp-admin`), you would create an `.htaccess` file inside that directory.

## Restricting Access

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create the .htaccess file">
    Create a new file named `.htaccess` inside the directory you want to protect. For a WordPress installation, this would typically be in the `/wp-admin/` directory.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add the access control code">
    Open the `.htaccess` file and add the following code:

    ```apache
    order deny, allow
    deny from all
    allow from YOUR-IP-ADDRESS-HERE
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Replace placeholder with your IP address">
    Replace `YOUR-IP-ADDRESS-HERE` with your actual IP address.
    <Note>
      You can find your current IP address by searching "what is my IP" on Google.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save and test">
    Save the `.htaccess` file. Now, try accessing the protected directory from your IP address. It should be accessible. Then, try accessing it from a different IP address; you should be denied access.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Example for WordPress Admin Area

If you have a WordPress blog installed on your main directory and you log in via `example.com/wp-admin`, you should create an `.htaccess` file in `/wp-admin/.htaccess` with the following content:

```apache
order deny, allow
deny from all
allow from YOUR-IP-ADDRESS-HERE
```

Remember to replace `YOUR-IP-ADDRESS-HERE` with your specific IP address.

<Tip>
  If you need to allow access from multiple IP addresses, you can add additional `allow from` lines for each IP.
  ```apache
  order deny, allow
  deny from all
  allow from 192.168.1.100
  allow from 10.0.0.5
  ```
</Tip>

<Warning>
  Ensure you correctly identify your IP address. If you use a dynamic IP address that changes frequently, this method might lock you out. Consider using a static IP or alternative security measures in such cases.
