External websites may display your website images on their sites, consuming your bandwidth. Hotlink Protection is a feature that prevents this.

## Enable Hotlink Protection

<Steps>
  <Step title="Log in to your cPanel account">
    Access your cPanel dashboard.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Navigate to Hotlink Protection">
    In the **Security** section, click on **Hotlink Protection**.
    <Frame>
      <img 
        src="/images/kb/hotlink-protection-icon.gif" 
        alt="Hotlink Protection icon in cPanel"
        style={{ width: '100%', height: 'auto' }}
      />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enable Hotlink Protection">
    If it displays "Hotlink protection is currently disabled", click on the **Enable** button.
    <Frame>
      <img 
        src="/images/kb/hotlink-protection-enable.gif" 
        alt="Enable Hotlink Protection button"
        style={{ width: '100%', height: 'auto' }}
      />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Configure Allowed URLs

Under **URLs to allow access**, you can specify external websites or subdomains that are permitted to link to your images.

For example, if you have a subdomain like `demo.example.com`, you can add its URL to this list to allow it to display your images.

<Note>
  By configuring allowed URLs, you ensure that only trusted domains can hotlink your content, effectively saving bandwidth and enhancing your website's security.
</Note>

Once configured, you have successfully protected your website images from unauthorized use on external websites.
