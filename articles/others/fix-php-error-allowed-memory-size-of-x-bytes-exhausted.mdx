If you encounter a PHP error similar to "Allowed memory size of X bytes exhausted" in a specific file, this guide will help you resolve it by adjusting your server's memory limit using the `.htaccess` file.

## Understanding the Error

The "Allowed memory size of X bytes exhausted" error means that a PHP script has tried to use more memory than is currently allocated to it. This can happen with complex scripts, plugins, or themes that require significant resources.

## Resolving the Error with .htaccess

You can often fix this issue by increasing the memory limit directly in your `.htaccess` file.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Locate or Create .htaccess File">
    Navigate to your website's root directory or the specific directory where the error is occurring. Look for a file named `.htaccess`. If it doesn't exist, you'll need to create it.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Memory Limit Code">
    Open the `.htaccess` file with a text editor and add the following line:
    ```apache
    RLimitMem max
    ```
    <Note>
      If you are unsure where to place the `.htaccess` file, start by placing it in your primary domain's root directory. If the error persists, try placing a copy of the `.htaccess` file in the specific directory where the error is reported (e.g., `example.com/directory/folder/.htaccess`).
    </Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save and Test">
    Save the `.htaccess` file and refresh the page that was causing the error. The error should now be resolved.
  </Step>
</Steps>

If the error continues even after applying these changes, it might indicate a more complex issue with your hosting environment or the script itself.
