If your website uses long URLs like `example.com/files/folder/sitemap.html`, you can create shorter, more user-friendly URLs such as `example.com/sitemap` using the `.htaccess` file.

This guide will walk you through the process.

## Steps to Create User-Friendly URLs

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enable Rewrite Engine">
    First, you need to ensure the rewrite engine is enabled. Add the following line to your `.htaccess` file:

    ```apache
    RewriteEngine on
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Define the Rewrite Rule">
    Next, define the rule to map the user-friendly URL to the actual URL. Replace `/sitemap/` with your desired user-friendly URL path and `/files/folder/sitemap.html` with the actual path to your file.

    ```apache
    RewriteRule ^sitemap/$ /files/folder/sitemap.html [L]
    ```

    *   `^sitemap/$`: This is the pattern for the user-friendly URL. The `^` signifies the beginning of the string, `sitemap` is the desired URL slug, and `/$` signifies the end of the string.
    *   `/files/folder/sitemap.html`: This is the actual path to the file on your server that the user-friendly URL will point to.
    *   `[L]`: This flag means that this is the last rule to be processed if it matches.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Example

Let's say you have a page located at `example.com/products/electronics/television.html` and you want to make it accessible via `example.com/television`.

You would add the following to your `.htaccess` file:

```apache
RewriteEngine on
RewriteRule ^television/$ /products/electronics/television.html [L]
```

Now, when a user visits `example.com/television`, they will be seamlessly redirected to `example.com/products/electronics/television.html`.

<Note>
Ensure that your `.htaccess` file is placed in the root directory of your website. If it's not there, the rules may not be applied correctly.
</Note>

<Tip>
You can use this technique for any page or resource on your website to improve SEO and user experience. Just adapt the `RewriteRule` to match your specific needs.
