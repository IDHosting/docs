This article explains how to use the `.htaccess` file to redirect visitors from a non-existent page or an old website to a new destination.

## Redirecting Pages

You can redirect visitors from a specific page to another page on the same domain, or to an entirely different website.

### Redirecting to a Different Domain

To redirect a specific page to a different domain, use the following `.htaccess` configuration:

```bash
RewriteEngine on
Redirect 301 /mypage.html http://example.com
```

This configuration will redirect anyone trying to access `/mypage.html` to `http://example.com`.

### Redirecting to Another Page on the Same Domain

To redirect from one page to another within the same website, use this configuration:

```bash
#Redirect from a page/directory to another page
Redirect 301 /oldpage.html /newpage.html
```

With this rule in place, when a visitor accesses `example.com/oldpage.html`, they will be automatically redirected to `example.com/newpage.html`.

<Note>
The `Redirect 301` command indicates a permanent redirect. This is important for SEO as it tells search engines that the content has moved permanently and to update their indexes accordingly.
