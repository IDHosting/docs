You can shut down your Virtualizor VPS in two ways: forcefully or gracefully. This guide will walk you through both methods.

## Gracefully Shut Down the VPS

Gracefully shutting down ensures that all running processes are stopped properly before the VPS powers off.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Log in to Virtualizor">
    Access your Virtualizor Control Panel.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Navigate to List VPS">
    From the left-side panel, click on **List VPS**.

        alt="Virtualizor List VPS menu item"
        style={{ width: '100%', height: 'auto' }}
      />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Manage VPS">
    Hover your mouse over the desired VPS row until it's highlighted. Then, click the **Wrench icon** on that line.

        alt="Clicking the wrench icon to manage VPS"
        style={{ width: '100%', height: 'auto' }}
      />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Stop the VPS">
    On the top-right side of the VPS management page, click the **Stop icon**.
    <Frame>
      <img 
        src="/images/kb/virtualizor-gracefully-shutdown.gif" 
        alt="Stop icon for graceful shutdown"
        style={{ width: '100%', height: 'auto' }}
      />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
</Steps>

The VPS will begin its graceful shutdown process, which may take some time. A confirmation message will appear once it's complete.

## Forcefully Shut Down the VPS

Forcefully shutting down immediately cuts power to the VPS. Use this method with caution as it can lead to data loss if applications are not closed properly.

To force shut down, click the **Power Off** option within the VPS management interface.

    style={{ width: '100%', height: 'auto' }}
  />

## Shut Down the VPS via Command Line (Forceful)

This method is equivalent to pulling the power cord and carries a risk of data loss.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Log in via SSH">
    Connect to your VPS using an SSH client.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Execute the poweroff command">
    Enter the following command and press Enter:
    ```bash
    poweroff
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

The VPS will shut down immediately after the command is executed.
