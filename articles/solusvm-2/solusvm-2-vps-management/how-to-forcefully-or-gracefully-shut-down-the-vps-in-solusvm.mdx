You can shut down your VPS in SolusVM 2 using two methods: a graceful shutdown or a forceful shutdown. This guide will walk you through both processes.

## Gracefully Shut Down the VPS in SolusVM 2

A graceful shutdown ensures that all running processes are terminated properly, minimizing the risk of data corruption.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Log in to SolusVM 2">
    Access your SolusVM 2 Control Panel by logging in with your credentials.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Project">
    Under the **Projects** section, click on the **project** that contains the VPS you wish to shut down.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Select VPS">
    Click on the specific VPS you want to manage.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Initiate Stop">

        alt="SolusVM 2 Stop VPS"
        style={{ width: '100%', height: 'auto' }}
      />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm Shutdown">
    Click **Yes** in the confirmation dialog to proceed with the shutdown.

        style={{ width: '100%', height: 'auto' }}
      />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
</Steps>

The VPS will begin shutting down. This process may take some time, and a confirmation message will be displayed once it's complete.

## Forcefully Shut Down the VPS in SolusVM 2

For a forceful shutdown, you can use the **Power Off** option. This is similar to pulling the power cord and should be used with caution as it may lead to data loss.

## Shut Down the VPS via the Command Line

You can also shut down your VPS using the command line via SSH.

<Warning>
  This method is equivalent to abruptly cutting power and carries a risk of data loss. Use it only when necessary.
</Warning>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Log in via SSH">
    Connect to your VPS using an SSH client.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Execute Power Off Command">
    Enter the following command and press Enter:
    ```bash
    poweroff
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

The VPS will shut down immediately after the command is executed.
