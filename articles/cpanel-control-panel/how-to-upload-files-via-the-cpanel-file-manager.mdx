You can use cPanel's built-in file manager instead of an FTP program to manage your website files.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Log in to cPanel">
    Access your cPanel account by logging in with your credentials.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open File Manager">
    In the **Files** section, click on the **File Manager** icon.
    <Frame>
      <img 
        src="/images/kb/filemanager-icon.gif" 
        alt="cPanel File Manager icon"
        style={{ width: '100%', height: 'auto' }}
      />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Navigate to the Directory">
    In the cPanel File Manager, navigate to the directory where you want to upload your files. The `public_html` directory is the most common location for website files. To access it, click on **public_html** in the list of directories on the left side.

        alt="Upload button in cPanel File Manager"
        style={{ width: '100%', height: 'auto' }}
      />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select and Upload Files">
    Click on **Select File** and choose the file you want to upload from your computer. Click **Open**, and the upload process will begin. Alternatively, you can drag and drop files from your computer directly into the upload box.
