This guide will walk you through the process of creating a cron job in cPanel. Cron jobs are automated tasks that run at specified intervals, useful for website maintenance, backups, and more.

## Steps to Create a Cron Job

<Steps>
  <Step title="Log in to cPanel">
    Access your cPanel account by navigating to your cPanel login URL and entering your credentials.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Navigate to Cron Jobs">
    Once logged in, scroll down to the **Advanced** section and click on **Cron Jobs**.

    <Frame>
      <img
        src="/images/kb/cronjob-icon.gif"
        alt="cPanel Cron Jobs Icon"
        style={{ width: '100%', height: 'auto' }}
      />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Cron Job Settings">
    Under the **Add New Cron Job** section, click the **Common Settings** drop-down menu. Select a predefined schedule like **Once Per Day**, **Once Per Hour**, or choose a custom interval if needed.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter Command or Script Path">
    In the **Command** field, enter the full path to your script (e.g., `/usr/bin/php /home/yourusername/public_html/your_script.php`) or the specific command you wish to execute.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add the Cron Job">
    After configuring the settings and entering the command, click the **Add New Cron Job** button.

      <img
        src="/images/kb/add-cronjob.gif"
        alt="Add New Cron Job Button in cPanel"
        style={{ width: '100%', height: 'auto' }}
      />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
</Steps>

  Ensure that the command or script path you enter is correct. An incorrect path or command will prevent the cron job from running.
