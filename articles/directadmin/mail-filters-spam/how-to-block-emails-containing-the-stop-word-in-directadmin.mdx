## Blocking Emails by Stop Word in DirectAdmin

This guide will walk you through the process of blocking emails that contain specific keywords or "stop words" using DirectAdmin's built-in spam filtering features.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Log in to DirectAdmin">
    Access your DirectAdmin control panel by logging in with your credentials.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Navigate to SPAM Filters">
    In the **E-Mail Manager** section, click on **SPAM Filters**.
    Alternatively, you can use the **search bar** at the top of the DirectAdmin interface, type "SPAM Filters", and select the option when it appears.

  <Step title="Select 'Stop Word' Option">

        alt="DirectAdmin Block By Stop Word configuration"
        style={{ width: '100%', height: 'auto' }}
      />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Apply the Block">
    Click the **Block** button to save your settings and activate the spam filter for the specified stop word.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  To prevent blocking emails with partial matches (e.g., blocking "apple" from also blocking "pineapple"), consider adding spaces before and after your stop word in the <strong>Value</strong> field. For example, entering ` apple ` will only block emails containing the exact word "apple" surrounded by spaces.
</Tip>

You can repeat this process to add multiple stop words to your blocklist.
