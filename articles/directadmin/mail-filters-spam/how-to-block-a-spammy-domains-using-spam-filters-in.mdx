If you are receiving spam emails from the same domain but with different email addresses, you can block the entire domain in DirectAdmin to prevent further unwanted messages.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Log in to DirectAdmin">
    Access your DirectAdmin account by logging in with your credentials.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Navigate to SPAM Filters">
    In the **E-Mail Manager** section, click on **SPAM Filters**. Alternatively, you can use the **search bar** at the top of your DirectAdmin interface, type "SPAM Filters", and select the option when it appears.
