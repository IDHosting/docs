You can modify PHP's `upload_max_filesize` setting to accommodate larger file uploads through the CloudLinux PHP Selector available in your DirectAdmin control panel.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Log in to DirectAdmin">
    Access your DirectAdmin account by navigating to your server's DirectAdmin URL and entering your credentials.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Access PHP Selector">
    In the **Extra Features** section of your DirectAdmin dashboard, locate and click on **Select PHP version**. Alternatively, you can type "Select PHP" into the navigation filter box to find it.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Navigate to Options">
    Once inside the PHP Selector interface, click on the **Options** menu.

    </Frame>
    <Note>
      If you encounter an error related to the native PHP version on the Options page, you will first need to change your PHP version to a non-native one before proceeding.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Adjust upload_max_filesize">
    Locate the **upload_max_filesize** setting. Click on the current value displayed in the drop-down menu next to it and select the desired limit that meets your requirements.
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/kb/cl-upload-max_filesize.gif" alt="CloudLinux upload_max_filesize setting" style={{ width: '100%', height: 'auto' }} />
    </Frame>
    After making your selection, a confirmation message will appear indicating that the maximum upload file size has been successfully updated.
