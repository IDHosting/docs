WordPress categories are a powerful tool for organizing your content. You can create hierarchical categories and assign multiple categories to a single post. This guide will walk you through the process of adding a new category.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Log in to WordPress">
    Begin by logging into your WordPress dashboard.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Navigate to Categories">
    From the **Dashboard** menu, navigate to **Posts** and then click on **Categories**.

        alt="WordPress dashboard showing Posts > Categories option"
        style={{ width: '100%', height: 'auto' }}
      />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter Category Details">
    In the **Add New Category** section, fill in the following details:
    *   **Name:** Enter the desired name for your category (e.g., "Computer").
    *   **Slug:** Provide a URL-friendly slug for the category. You can leave this blank, and WordPress will generate one automatically.
    *   **Parent:** Select **None** to create a top-level category. To create a sub-category, choose an existing category from the dropdown.
    *   **Description:** Optionally, enter a description for your category.
