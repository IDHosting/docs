      Clicking **Trash** moves the post to the trash bin. It is not permanently deleted at this stage. You can restore it from the trash if needed.

After clicking **Trash**, you will see a confirmation message indicating that the post has been moved to the Trash.

To permanently delete posts from the trash, navigate to **Posts** > **Trash** from the dashboard menu, and then click the **Empty Trash** button.
