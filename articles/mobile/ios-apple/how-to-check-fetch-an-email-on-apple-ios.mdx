You can set your email for automatic syncing. However, should you want to check for new emails manually, this tutorial will guide you through the process. Before checking for new email, ensure you have already added your email account to your device. If not, please refer to our tutorial on "How to add an email account on iPhone/iOS."

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the Mail App">
    From your Apple device's main screen, tap on the **Mail** icon.

        style={{ width: '100%', height: 'auto' }}
      />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Your Email Account">
    Under the **Mailboxes** list, tap on your **email account**.

      />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Manually Refresh Your Inbox">
    If your emails are not automatically syncing, tap and hold on the screen from the top of the inbox, then pull down and release. This action will initiate a check for new emails.

      />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="View New Emails">
    Congratulations! You have successfully learned how to check for emails manually. Any new emails received will now display on your screen. If there are no new messages, you will see an empty inbox.
