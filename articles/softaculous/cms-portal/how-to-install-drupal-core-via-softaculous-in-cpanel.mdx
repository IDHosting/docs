  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Software Setup">
    Fill in the necessary fields under the **Software Setup** section:
    *   **Choose Installation URL**: Select the appropriate protocol and domain. If you wish to install Drupal Core in a subdirectory (e.g., `example.com/directory`), enter the directory name in the "In Directory" field. Leave it blank to install in your main domain (e.g., `example.com`).
    *   **Choose the version you want to install**: You can typically leave this at its default setting.
    *   **Cron job**: This can also usually be left at its default.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Site Settings">
    Under the **Site Settings** section, enter the following:
    *   **Site Name**: Provide a name for your website (e.g., "My First Website").
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Admin Account">
    Under the **Admin Account** section, enter the following details:
    *   **Admin Username**: Choose a username for your Drupal Core administrator account. For security, avoid common usernames like "admin" or "administrator".
    *   **Admin Password**: Create a strong password for your administrator account.
    *   **Admin Email**: Enter your email address.

    <Note>
      It is highly recommended to copy your admin username and password to a secure location, such as Notepad, as you will need them to log in to your Drupal Core admin area later.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Advanced Options and Finalize Installation">
    You can review the **Advanced Options** if you wish to change the database name or configure automated backups. Be mindful that frequent backups can consume significant disk space.
    <br />
    Once you have completed all the necessary fields, scroll to the bottom of the page and click the **Install** button.
