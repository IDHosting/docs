  <Step title="Configure Software Setup">
    Fill in the necessary fields under the **Software Setup** section:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Choose Installation URL:</strong> Select the desired protocol (e.g., `http://` or `https://`) and your domain. In the "<strong>In Directory</strong>" field, enter a directory name if you want to install ProcessWire in a subdirectory (e.g., `example.com/directory`). Leave it blank to install in the root of your domain (e.g., `example.com`).

  <Step title="Configure Site Settings">
    Under the **Site Settings** section, provide the following:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Admin Folder:</strong> Specify a name for your ProcessWire admin folder. For security, it's recommended to use something other than the default, like `admin123`.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Up Admin Account">
    Under the **Admin Account** section, enter:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Admin Username:</strong> Choose a username for your ProcessWire admin login. Avoid common usernames like "admin" or "administrator" for better security.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Admin Password:</strong> Create a strong and secure password.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Admin Email:</strong> Enter a valid email address.
      </li>
    </ul>

        style={{ width: '100%', height: 'auto' }}
      />
    </Frame>
    <Note>
      It is highly recommended to copy your admin username and password to a secure location, such as a password manager or a text file, as you will need them to log in to your ProcessWire admin area later.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Advanced Options (Optional)">
    You can configure **Advanced Options** if you wish to change the default database name or set up automated backups. Be mindful that frequent backups can consume significant disk space.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Complete Installation">
    Scroll to the bottom of the page and click the **Install** button to begin the installation process.
